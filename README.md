# Logistic regression (mini lecture)

This was a talk presented by [Damjan Vukcevic](http://damjan.vukcevic.net/) on
11 October 2016 at the University of Melbourne, as part of an assessment for
a lectureship position.

## Details of the talk

The task given to us was described as follows:

> Introduce logistic regression to students who are familiar with linear
regression, hypothesis testing and basic ideas of parameter estimation.
Illustrate its application with reference to analysis of genotypes at
a diallelic SNP locus in a case-control study.  You may assume that the
students are familiar with SNP genotypes and case-control studies.  You should
discuss appropriate hypothesis tests and estimation of parameters measuring
genetic effect sizes.  There is no need to discuss a wide range of possible
tests and estimates, select the most important ones appropriate for an
undergraduate class.

We were allowed 20 minutes for the lecture, plus question time.
